"R is not a fast language. This is not an accident. R was purposely designed to make data analysis and statistics easier for you to do. It was not designed to make life easier for your computer." - Hadley Wickham, "Advanced R"

The quote above comes from the "Advanced R" book written by Hadley Wickham in regard to R as a programming language. While R may not be as fast as other programming languages, by measuring and improving the performance of your code, you can reduce the time is takes to run and help eliminate potential bottlenecks.

The following three examples will give you an opportunity to utilize the "bench" package to compare the runtime of common functions.

Prior to following along with the use cases, make sure that you have downloaded the "flight_data.csv" file from the GitHub repository as it will be used in the second example.

We will be utilizing the following packages for these use cases.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(beeswarm)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(readr)
```


# Use Case 1: The sqrt() function vs. x^2
The following will be an example of how to compare two simple functions that are accomplishing the same goal, taking the square root of a specified number.
```{r}

x <- runif(500)

#Creating two functions to take the square root of a provided number
function_1 <- function(x) {
  sqrt(x)
}

function_2 <- function(x) {
  (x)^0.5
}


#Use bench to compare the run time of each function
bench::mark(function_1(x), function_2(x))

#You can visualize this by plotting the results
plot(bench::mark(function_1(x), function_2(x)))
```

# Use Case 2: system_time()
What if you want to see how quickly your code runs without necessarily having to compare it to another function? This is where system_time() can be useful. The use case below will demonstrate how this is done with the readr::read_csv() and read.csv() functions.
```{r}

#First, we will assign the bench::system_time() function to an object in order to view them easily momentarily
stats_readr <- bench::system_time(readr::read_csv("flight_data_smaller.csv"))

stats_base <- bench::system_time(read.csv("flight_data_smaller.csv"))

#Running just one line will allow you to observe how long it takes one item to run, while running both lines below simultaneously will allow you to compare them to each other
stats_readr
stats_base


```


# Use Case 3: colSums() vs. apply()
If you'll recall during the presentation, we made a point of noting how colSums(), rowSums(), colMeans(), and rowMeans() are all individually faster than the alternative function, apply(). The following example will look specifically at colSums() and how it is more efficient at providing the sum of each column than apply().

``` {r}
#Here we create an example matrix where we will ultimately sum the column values
example_matrix <- matrix(C<-(1:10),nrow=5, ncol=8)


#Below are the two functions being compared
function_apply <- apply(example_matrix, 2, sum)
function_colSums <- colSums(example_matrix)

#Running the two lines below will show how both functions result in the same value
function_apply
function_colSums

#Using bench, we can observe that function_colSums has many more iterations per second and is thus faster
bench::mark(function_apply, function_colSums)


```
