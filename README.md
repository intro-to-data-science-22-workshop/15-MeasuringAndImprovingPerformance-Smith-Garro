# Measuring and Improving Performance

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce the general idea of profiling code and benchmarking functions to find the faster and most efficient solutions. The packages profvis and bench allow you to do this through simple coding and very useful outputs.


### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to 
* equip you with general conepts of code performance and efficiency
* show you the packages profvis and bench to use them for your code
* provide you with hands on exercises for better comprehension
